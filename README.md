# Stock-project
Machine learning has significant applications in stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, we will be talking about predicting the returns on stocks. This is a very complex task and has uncertainties.

We will develop this project into two parts:

1. First, we will learn how to predict stock price using the LSTM neural network.
2. Then we will build a dashboard using Plotly dash for stock analysis.
